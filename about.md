My name is Shuzhan Fan, a fourth-year Phd in geography at Louisiana State University. I also have a Master's degree in computer science. I consider myself as a data scientist, as I play with data everyday. My current research is studying the application of deep learning in real-time crime forecasting. I also work as a research assistant at LSU's Earth Scan Lab. My routine duties in the lab include writing codes to develop new satellite image products, as well as running and maintaining scripts to process satellite data and create images, which are used by lots of institutes and organizations including NOAA and NASA.

### More

Personally, I'm a big college football fan and an unofficial Bama 'hater'. I love the Beatles, Bob Dylan, Coldplay, Adele. I love reading, now I'm building this website to start my 'blog writing career'. And I'm a cat lover. If you are curious about my profile picture, that's right, it's my cat.
